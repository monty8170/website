      <p>This is my very first website. One day, while watching training videos on Security+, I stumbled across freecodecamp's <u>Responsive Web Design Certification</u> and gave it a try. Little did I know I would become hooked on writing code but here I am, jacking this HTML page up like a noobie. One thing I have learned is the more that I mess up, the more I must read/watch/learn to fix it. I steer away from just copying and pasting because I will never retain any of the information that way. I have a newfound passion that I have not had since I was in Law Enforcement. Getting up at 4am to learn, takes a lot of motivation since I am married to a night owl. My wife and I normally go to bed around 11:30pm-12am. Since we have two small kids, our alone time is cherished and consists of watching shows, eating wings, and just enjoying each otherâ€™s company...oh and hiking!

      <p>As I gain experience, this page will grow.  I hope that if you are reading this, you will keep up with my prgoress as I continue to learn and practice.  I will eventually upload my projects as I complete them.
